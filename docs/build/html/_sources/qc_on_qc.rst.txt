.. _qubit-mapping:
The Jordan-Wigner Transformation
--------------------------------

When performing calculations on a quantum computer, electronic states of
the system of interest need to be mapped to qubit states within the
quantum computer (and vice-versa). The occupation of each electronic
state can be represented by a qubit state, specifically the
:math:`|1\rangle_{i}` qubit state represents the electronic spin orbital
:math:`i` being occupied, while the :math:`|0\rangle_{i}` qubit state
represents an unoccupied electronic state :math:`i`. However, the
antisymmetric nature of the electronic wavefunction, which stems from
the anticommutativity of the fermionic operators, needs to be
transferred to the qubits. On the other hand, qubit states are
represented by spins and manipulated by unitary operations corresponding to
rotations around the Bloch sphere [Nielsen2010]_. The latter are
expressed as Pauli matrices
{:math:`\sigma^{x}, \sigma^{y}, \sigma^{z}`}, or tensor products thereof
known as Pauli strings. Hence, the problem of mapping between electrons
and qubits translates to "keeping track" of the electronic exchange
symmetry within the string of Pauli operators that define gate
operations on the qubits. In ``EUMEN``, this can be accomplished using either the
Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation [McArdle2020]_ or the Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) transformation [Seeley2012]_. 

Using JW as an example, the fermion ladder operators can be expressed in terms of the Pauli spin matrices
as follows

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-12}
       c_{i}^{\dagger} = \Bigg(\prod_{j<i}\sigma_{j}^{z}\Bigg)\sigma_{i}^{-}

.. math:: c_{i} = \bigg(\prod_{j<i}\sigma_{j}^{z}\bigg)\sigma_{i}^{+}

where

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-13}
       \sigma_{i}^{\pm} = (\sigma_{i}^{x} \pm i\sigma_{i}^{y})/2 .

In the Pauli basis, operators can be expressed as sums over Pauli
strings :math:`P_{\alpha}`. For example the qubit Hamiltonian is

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-14}
       H_{Q} = \sum_{\alpha}h_{\alpha}P_{\alpha} = \sum_{\alpha}h_{\alpha}\bigotimes_{i}^{N_{Q}}\sigma_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}.

Where :math:`h_\alpha` is the coefficient of each Pauli term. Note the
same index :math:`i` is used for electronic spin orbitals and qubits; in
fact, the number of spin orbitals in the calculation is equal the number
of qubits :math:`N_{Q}`. Also, the cluster operator and electronic
wavefunction can be written in terms of Pauli strings. Keeping in mind
that the strings :math:`P_{\alpha}` depend on the set of control
parameters :math:`\vec{\theta}`, which parametrize gate operations on
qubits, the energy expectation value is thus a function of these
parameters that will be variationally optimised in order to find the
minimum energy.

Variational Quantum Eigensolver
-------------------------------

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a method for calculating
the ground state energy and wavefunction on NISQ devices. It is a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm that starts from an initial HF state from
which one obtains a correlated ground state, using an initial guess for the cluster amplitudes (e.g.
randomised or using values from second-order MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation
theory). This ground state ansatz is transformed to a Pauli basis using
the JW transformation, so that
:math:`e^{T - T^{\dagger}}|\text{HF}\rangle = |\Psi\rangle \rightarrow |\Psi(\vec{\theta})\rangle`,
allowing for encoding of the fermionic wavefunction onto the qubit
register (the "Entangler" step in figure :numref:`VQE`).

The expectation value of the Hamiltonian in this basis is calculated as
a sum over Pauli strings (tensor products of Pauli terms), where each
string is measured on the quantum device. This is performed by
repeatedly measuring the state of each qubit, with the individual Pauli
terms applied as prerotations before measurement to rotate the
measurement axis. Expectation values of Pauli strings are then
determined by multiplying the measurement results and averaging over
many repetitions. Summing over the Pauli strings then yields an estimation
for the ground state energy (the cost function to be minimised) for that
particular set of amplitudes. The energy and amplitudes are then fed
into a classical computer that variationally optimises the amplitudes as
parameters of a cost function, yielding a set of parameters which
lower the energy. These new parameters are fed back into the quantum
device to yield a new measurement of the energy and a new set of
parameters. This iterative procedure is repeated until a convergence
criterion is reached (e.g. the energy stops changing from one iteration
to the next). As this method is variational, the energy at the end of
the VQE procedure is an approximation to the ground state energy. This
is shown schematically in the figure :numref:`VQE`.

.. _VQE:

The iterative VQE procedure can be summarised by the following steps:

#. With the qubit register initialised to all zeros
   :math:`|000...\rangle`, the qubit representation of the HF state is
   prepared by applying a set of (non-parametrized) gate operations
   (for example, X gates) to the qubit register

   .. math:: |\text{HF}\rangle_{Q} = U_{\text{HF}}|000...\rangle

#. From the initial HF state, the correlated wavefunction ansatz is
   prepared by applying the JW transformed UCC cluster operator, i.e. a
   set of parametrized unitary rotations of the qubits states, to
   :math:`|\text{HF}\rangle_{Q}`

   .. math:: |\Psi(\vec{\theta}\rangle = U(\vec{\theta})|\text{HF}\rangle_{Q}

#. The energy is then measured by measuring the expectation value of
   each Pauli string over the qubit representation of the wavefunction
   ansatz, and summing over the measurements

   .. math::

      \label{eqn4-15}
          E(\vec{\theta}) = \sum_{\alpha}h_{\alpha}\langle\Psi(\vec{\theta})|P_{\alpha}|\Psi(\vec{\theta})\rangle \geq E_{min} .
   
   .. _sec-methods-vqe:

   The results of multiple measurements are then averaged to obtain the
   average expectation value of energy.

#. The energy and qubit rotation parameters are then fed into a
   classical computer that runs an optimisation algorithm (e.g.
   conjugate-gradient, or BFGS), which returns a new set of parameters.

#. The new set of parameters are then used to prepare a new ansatz state
   :math:`|\Psi(\vec{\theta})\rangle`, from which a new sum over pauli
   expectation values, and hence a new energy expectation value, is
   calculated.

#. The previous two steps are repeated until a convergence criteria,
   typically the difference in energy between VQE iterations, is below
   some threshold value.

Quantum Subspace Expansion
--------------------------

While VQE calculates ground state energies, the quantum subspace
expansion (QSE) is a method for calculating energies of excited
molecular states [McClean2017]_. It can also improve
the accuracy of the ground state calculation relative to VQE. The QSE
method solves a generalised eigenvalue problem within the
:math:`\eta`-electron Fock space,

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-16}
       H^{QSE}C = S^{QSE}C\varepsilon,

in which the Hamiltonian matrix :math:`H_{QSE}` has a set of
eigenvectors :math:`C`. This is a linear response
expansion of the ground state. The elements of :math:`H_{QSE}` are
formed by the application of fermionic operators to the (optimised)
ground state, i.e. a projection to the subspace written as

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-17}
       H_{ijkl}^{QSE} = \langle\Psi|c_ic_j^{\dagger}Hc_k^{\dagger}c_l|\Psi\rangle,

where each set of creation/annihilation operators expresses the addition
and removal of electrons to and from spin orbitals in this subspace. As
the subspace contains states which are not necessarily orthogonal, the
overlap matrix is needed

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-18}
       S_{ijkl}^{QSE} = \langle\Psi|c_ic_j^{\dagger}c_k^{\dagger}c_l|\Psi\rangle.

The elements of these matrices are also mapped
to qubit representations (using the JW or BK) which in turn
generates the matrices from the ground state
:math:`|\Psi(\vec\theta)\rangle` obtained from the VQE algorithm, and the
qubit representations of the matrix elements are measured on the quantum
hardware. The matrix :math:`H_{ijkl}^{QSE}` is then diagonalized
(classically) to obtain the eigenvalue matrix :math:`\varepsilon`.

.. _sec-methods-penalty:

Penalty Functions
-----------------

The ability to include a penalty term to the energy evaluation during VQE optimisation is available
in ``EUMEN``. This ia a useful tool which can correct for
errors in the energy (e.g. arising from spin contamination when the
wavefunction is expressed in an unrestricted form) [Ryabinkin2019]_. Hence the optimiser
will "penalise" the energy, such that when the parameters are optimised
the offending term will be reduced towards 0 as the energy is minimised.

Penalty functions can also be used to calculate excited state energies [Higgott2019]_ in a method called Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD). To see this, the
VQE algorithm can be extended to optimise the following function

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-19}
       E_{\text{oc}}(\vec{\theta}') = \langle\Psi_{ex}(\vec{\theta}')|H|\Psi_{ex}(\vec{\theta}')\rangle + \beta|\langle\Psi_{ex}(\vec{\theta}')|\Psi_{gs}(\vec{\theta})\rangle|^{2}

where :math:`H` is the Hamiltonian corresponding to the ground state
(used in the optimisation of the ground state energy in VQE),
:math:`|\Psi_{ex}(\vec{\theta}')\rangle` is the wavefunction ansatz for the
excited state, :math:`|\Psi_{gs}(\vec{\theta})\rangle`
is the previously optimised ground state wavefunction, and :math:`\beta`
is a sufficiently large positive constant (dictating the effective
"size" of the penalty). A typical choice for :math:`\beta` is the
absolute value of the energy of the VQE optimised ground state,
\|\ :math:`\langle\Psi_{gs}(\vec{\theta})|H|\Psi_{gs}(\vec{\theta})\rangle`
[Lee2019]_. This is effectively an energy optimization subject to the constraint that
excited state must be orthogonal to the (previously optimised) ground state. 
It can be extended to the next excited state by adding an additional orthogonality constraint. The advantage of this method over QSE is the
improved scaling of computational resources, as the circuit depth (the
number of time steps in the quantum circuit, where a time step is a
parallel arrangement of gates across the qubit register executed
simultaneously) required to implement VQD will scale linearly in the
excitation level relative to VQE, hence twice the circuit depth for the
first excited state. However, due to the
accumulation of errors from one excitation level to the next, this
method is best suited only for low lying excited states.
