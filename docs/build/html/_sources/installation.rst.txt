Installation
============

To install ``EUMEN`` and the packages necessary to run ``EUMEN``, the package management
system `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip>`_ is required. We recommend using Python 3.8 for running ``EUMEN``.
The most convenient way to do this is to create a conda environment. To
install conda, see `the conda documentation <http://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install>`_.

Then create a conda environment with python version 3.8 specified. In a
terminal, type:

| ``conda create -n your-env python=3.8``
| ``conda activate your-env``

Then install ``EUMEN`` from the private python index provided with the beta credentials:

``pip install eumen -i <index-url>``

For support with Jupyter Notebooks (required for the tutorials and demonstrations), please also type:

``pip install notebook``

Within the private documentation accessible by beta testers, there are several tutorials and examples of how to use ``EUMEN``.
