Introduction
============
The advent of quantum computation represents the beginning of a new era
for molecular simulation, allowing exact quantum calculations to be executed.

``EUMEN`` serves as an enabler to tackle problems intractable on classical
computers.
By providing access the latest quantum hardware,
``EUMEN`` accelerates application research
with industry in the following areas:

- pharmaceuticals,
- specialty chemicals
- performance materials,
- agrochemicals,
- renewable energy,


Users of ``EUMEN`` will have access to world leading circuit optimisation
protocols developed within a paradigm of barrier free use of all
quantum architectures and total portability of end products.
This allows users to attain the maximal value from noisy intermediate
scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In addition,
every user of ``EUMEN`` will have access to the expertise and technical-support
of CQCâ€™s quantum chemistry team.

An overview of ``EUMEN`` platform is presented in :numref:`EumenOverview`.

   Schematic overview of the ``EUMEN`` platform.

Once the system of interest is specified by the client, this is taken as
the input to ``EUMEN``. The quantum instruction set is prepared, executed on and
retrieved from a quantum backend using CQC's quantum SDK, tket.
The quantum backend (accessed via tket) can be a cloud-provisioned
quantum computer or a CPU simulator designed to emulate calculations on
quantum hardware. ``EUMEN`` provides the logic to go post-process the
quantum measurement result to useful chemistry information.

``EUMEN`` utilises
CQC the retargetable compiler
`tket <https://cqcl.github.io/pytket/build/html/index.html>`_ python
to access quantum hardware. Through tket,
support is provided for:

- `Google Cirq <https://www.github.com/quantumlib/cirq>`_,
- `IBMQ Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/>`_,
- `AQT <https://www.aqt.eu/services/>`_,
- `Honeywell Quantum System <https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/company/quantum>`_,
- `Amazon Braket <https://aws.amazon.com/braket/>`_,
- `Microsoft QSharp <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/>`_,
- `Qulacs <https://docs.qulacs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_,
- `Rigetti pyQuil <http://rigetti.com/forest>`_ and `IonQ <https://ionq.com/>`_.
