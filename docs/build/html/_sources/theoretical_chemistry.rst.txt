Coupled Cluster
---------------

The field of quantum chemistry largely relies on the development of
methods for approximating the exact the many-electron wavefunction.
Approximations are needed because of the intrinsic difficulty in solving
the many-electron Schrödinger equation. The simplest (antisymmetric)
solution is provided by the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. However, the HF
method in general fails to provide energies within chemical accuracy due
to the neglect of electronic correlation, beyond the exchange effects
between parallel spins obtained by expressing the wavefunction as a
single antisymmetrized product (Slater determinant) of spin orbitals.
The next step beyond the HF approximation towards better descriptions of
correlation involve expanding the wavefunction as a superposition of
Slater determinants, in which the treatment of correlation is defined by
the parametrisation of expansion coefficients (and the determinants
included in the expansion). Including all determinants of the
:math:`\eta`-electron Fock space in the superposition, and applying this
linearly to the HF state, is known as full configuration interaction
(FCI). However, FCI is not size-extensive, and size-extensivity is
important for accurate descriptions of chemical reaction barriers,
atomization energies, etc [Bartlett2007]_. A popular
method of including electronic correlation while maintaining
size-extensivity is to write the correlated wavefunction using the
exponential ansatz

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-1}
       |\Psi\rangle = e^{T}|\text{HF}\rangle,

where :math:`|\text{HF}\rangle` is the HF ground state wavefunction, and
:math:`T` is the excitation operator, defined as

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-2}
       T = \sum_{n}^{N}T_{n}

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-2a}
       T_{1} = \sum_{a,p}t_{a}^{p}c_{p}^{\dagger}c_{a}

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-2b}
       T_{2} = \sum_{a,b,p,q}t_{a,b}^{p,q}c_{p}^{\dagger}c_{q}^{\dagger}c_{a}c_{b}.

Here, parameters :math:`t_{a}^{p}, t_{a,b}^{p,q}` are excitation
amplitudes (or cluster amplitudes), and refer to single and double
excitations, respectively. The set of excitation amplitudes included in
a calculation can be written as the vector :math:`\vec{t}`. The indices
:math:`a, b` denote occupied spin orbitals, and :math:`p, q` denote
unoccupied (virtual) spin orbitals. The fermionic operator
:math:`c_{a}^{\dagger}` (:math:`c_{a}`) creates (annihilates) an
electron in spin orbital :math:`a`. This is the coupled cluster (CC)
method, and the :math:`e^{T}` term is referred to as the cluster
operator. Truncating this at the level of double excitations defines the
coupled cluster singles-doubles (CCSD) method, which for many systems of
interest represents a reasonably good approximation. The CC energy is
obtained by a projection of the Schrödinger equation

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-3}
       e^{-T}He^{T}|\text{HF}\rangle = E_{CC}|\text{HF}\rangle

where the second-quantized molecular Hamiltonian is written as (note atomic units are used throughout this documentation)

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-4}
       H = \sum_{i,j}h_{i,j}c_{i}^{\dagger}c_{j} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j,k,l}h_{i,j,k,l}c_{i}^{\dagger}c_{j}^{\dagger}c_{k}c_{l} + V_{nuc} ,

:math:`V_{nuc}` is the nuclear (classical) electrostatic repulsion, and
the one- and two-body electronic terms are obtained from integrals of
spin-orbitals obtained from a HF calculation

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-5}
       h_{i,j} = \int{d\mathbf{x}\phi_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\bigg(\frac{-\nabla^{2}}{2}} - \sum_{A}\frac{Z_{A}}{|\mathbf{R}_{A} - \mathbf{r}|}\bigg)\phi_{j}(\mathbf{x})

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-6}
       h_{i,j,k,l} = \int{d\mathbf{x}_{1}d\mathbf{x}_{2}\frac{\phi_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{x}_{1})\phi_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{x}_{2})\phi_{k}(\mathbf{x}_{1})\phi_{l}(\mathbf{x}_{2})}{|\mathbf{r}_{1} - \mathbf{r}_{2}|}}.

The index :math:`A` labels atoms, :math:`Z` is the nuclear charge,
:math:`R` is the atomic position in space, and :math:`\mathbf{r}` is the
electronic spatial coordinate. The variable :math:`\mathbf{x}`
represents the collection of spatial and spin coordinates
:math:`\mathbf{x} = \{\mathbf{r}, s\}`. Unfortunately, the cluster
operator is not unitary, which is required for the method to be
variational. By rewriting the linear operator :math:`T` as an anti-hermitian operator :math:`T - T^\dagger`,
the cluster operator then becomes unitary and we have the unitary coupled cluster (UCC)
method. The correlated wavefunction relative to the HF state then becomes

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-7}
        |\Psi\rangle = e^{T - T^\dagger}|\text{HF}\rangle.

This allows for the total energy of the system to be calculated by the
variational minimisation

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-8}
       E = \min_{\vec{t}}\langle\text{HF}|e^{T^{\dagger}-T}He^{T-T^{\dagger}}|\text{HF}\rangle.

While UCC is not tractable on classical computers (the expansion of
:math:`e^{T^{\dagger}-T}He^{T-T^{\dagger}}` does not truncate (see [Taube2006]_) it is in fact well suited for
calculation on a quantum computer. The reason for this is related to the
exponential scaling of the number of states that can be represented by a
register of qubits, compared to the linear scaling of classical
computers. Thus, using UCC as an ansatz for the wavefunction, a variational search for the ground state energy can be implemented in a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm
(discussed :doc:`here <qc_on_qc>`).

As with CC, UCC can usually be truncated to double excitations, yielding
the UCCSD method. Furthermore, UCCSD can be generalised to include
excitation amplitudes which are not just restricted to excitations from
occupied to virtual orbitals, but include excitations throughout the
entire orbital space. This amounts to extending the summation indices of
:math:`T_{1}` and :math:`T_{2}` to include occupied to occupied, virtual to virtual, occupied to virtual,
and virtual to occupied excitations. This yields a generalised ansatz
for the UCCSD wavefunction, and is known as UCCGSD [Lee2019]_.

Basis Sets
----------

Basis sets are necessary to represent electronic orbitals in a quantum
chemistry calculation. The spatial orbitals which enter a Slater
determinant, for example, can be expanded in terms of a finite set of
basis functions [Szabo1996]_. Many different kinds
of basis sets are possible. A minimal basis set refers to the minimum
number of such functions required to represent the ground state
electronic structure. For example, the H\ :math:`_{2}` molecule has the
minimal basis set known as the STO-3G basis set. The 1\ :math:`s`
orbital of a hydrogen atom (centred at the origin) can be represented by
a "Slater-type-orbital" (STO), which has the form

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-9}
       \phi_{1s}^{\texttt{sto}}(\zeta,\vec{r}) = \sqrt{\frac{\zeta^3}{\pi}}e^{-\zeta |\vec{r}|},

where :math:`\zeta` is the Slater orbital exponent (= 1 for H), and
:math:`r` is the radial distance from the atomic centre. The label
STO-3G refers to the STO being fit to a linear combination (a
contraction) of 3 Gaussian functions, where a Gaussian function has the
form

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-10}
       \phi^{\texttt{gto}}(\alpha,\vec{r}) = \bigg(\frac{2\alpha}{\pi}\bigg)^{3/4}e^{-\alpha |\vec{r}|^2},

and :math:`\alpha` is the Gaussian orbital exponent. The orbital
exponents are a measure of the spatial extent of the basis functions; a
small exponent means a large diffuse function, while a large exponent
means a dense, compact function. The higher angular momentum orbitals
can be written as polynomial (in the components of :math:`\vec{r}`)
generalisations of these functions. While STOs are generally more
accurate, GTOs are more practical for calculations. Consider the
two-electron integral shown above (:math:`h_{i,j,k,l}`). In
the general case, each of the four orbitals in this integral is centred
on a different atom, and the resulting four-centre integral can be
computationally demanding with STOs. However, the product of two GTOs
:math:`\phi^{\texttt{gto},a}` and :math:`\phi^{\texttt{gto},b}` with
different centres is, up to a constant, just another GTO with an
exponent that is the sum of exponents of :math:`\phi^{\texttt{gto},a}`
and :math:`\phi^{\texttt{gto},b}`, and centred on a line joining
:math:`\phi^{\texttt{gto},a}` and :math:`\phi^{\texttt{gto},b}`. This
makes it easier to evaluate two-electron integrals using GTOs, hence
their use. The higher accuracy of STOs, however, leads to the necessity
to fit linear combinations of GTOs to STOs. This is known as contraction
of the Gaussian functions, and can be expressed as

.. math::

   \label{eqn4-11}
       \phi_{n}^{c-\texttt{gto}}(\vec{r}) = \sum_{\nu}^{N}d_{\nu n}\phi_{\nu}^{\texttt{gto}}(\alpha_{\nu n},\vec{r})

Where :math:`n` labels the spatial atomic orbital, :math:`d_{\nu n}` are
contraction coefficients, :math:`\alpha_{\nu n}` are the orbital
contraction exponents, and for STO-3G, :math:`N` = 3. Basis functions
which adequately approximate STOs, while having the benefit of easier
integrals of GTOs, can be generated by the appropriate choice of
contraction coefficients, exponents, and :math:`N`.

``EUMEN`` also supports the selection of active and frozen orbitals. Active orbitals contribute directly to
the electronic integrals (:math:`h_{i,j}` and :math:`h_{i,j,k,l}`), and are involved in the cluster amplitudes
needed to generate the correlated wavefunction ansatz. By default, all
orbitals included in the calculation are active. Frozen orbitals are not
explicitly included in the Hamiltonian or wavefunction, but are simply
included as a contribution to the electrostatic energy of the atomic
cores. In addition, the contribution of the frozen orbitals are
projected out of the active orbitals, resulting in an effective
screening of the interaction between the remaining active orbitals.

In ``EUMEN``, `PySCF <https://sunqm.github.io/pyscf>`_ is used to acquire relevant data for
the molecule in the uncorrelated ground state (e.g. the HF state), data
that is needed before starting a (quantum) calculation of the correlated ground
state. This includes data for atoms in the molecule, the geometry of the
molecule, the basis sets used to represent the orbitals, and the electronic integrals involved in the matrix elements of the
Hamiltonian.
